Description: The goal of 'ggcoverage' is to simplify the process of visualizing genome coverage. It contains functions to 
    load data from 'BAM', 'BigWig' or 'BedGraph' files, create genome coverage plot, add various annotations to 
    the coverage plot, including GC annotation, gene annotation, transcript annotation, ideogram annotation and peak annotation.
